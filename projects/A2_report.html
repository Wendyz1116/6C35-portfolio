        <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Do areas with a higher percentage of single-family homes tend to
            have more older or retired people?
          </li>
          <p>
            Motivation: Growing up in Florida, I always heard people say that
            it’s a good place to retire to since there is usually more space and
            larger homes for families. This motivated me to look into whether
            this is common in Massachusetts, too where people other than 65 tend
            to live in areas with a higher percentage of single-family home
            zoning
          </p>
          <li>
            Do people of color or people with low incomes live in areas with a
            lower percentage of single-family homes?
          </li>
          <p>
            In “Houses are too expensive. Apartments are too small. Is this a
            fix?” (Washington Post) they said that “zoning laws [were] an
            implicit strategy to price people of color and low-income people out
            of certain neighborhoods.” This makes me wonder if neighborhoods
            with a higher percentage of single-family housing end up having
            fewer people of color and people with lower incomes.
          </p>
          <li>
            Do areas with a lower percentage of single-family homes have a
            higher population?
          </li>
          <p>
            In “Houses are too expensive. Apartments are too small. Is this a
            fix?” (Washington Post), they claim that with fewer
            single-family-only zones, there can be more housing options for
            people. This makes me wonder if there is a correlation between the
            percentage of single-family housing and the number of people living
            there.
