        <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Do areas with a higher percentage of single-family homes tend to
            have more older or retired people?
          </li>
          <p>
            Motivation: Growing up in Florida, I always heard people say that
            it’s a good place to retire to since there is usually more space and
            larger homes for families. This motivated me to look into whether
            this is common in Massachusetts, too where people other than 65 tend
            to live in areas with a higher percentage of single-family home
            zoning. I feel like this could be the case since older people may
            have more money to afford single-family homes and they may want more
            space for their families.
          </p>
          <li>
            Do people of color or people with low incomes live in areas with a
            lower percentage of single-family homes?
          </li>
          <p>
            In “Houses are too expensive. Apartments are too small. Is this a
            fix?” (Washington Post) they said that “zoning laws [were] an
            implicit strategy to price people of color and low-income people out
            of certain neighborhoods.” This makes me wonder if neighborhoods
            with a higher percentage of single-family housing end up having
            fewer people of color and people with lower incomes. I feel like
            this could be the case since single-family homes are more expensive
            and people may not be able to afford them, so they may end up living
            in areas with more cheaper multi-family housing options which may
            have a lower percentage of single-family homes.
          </p>
          <li>
            Do areas with a lower percentage of single-family homes have a
            higher population?
          </li>
          <p>
            In “Houses are too expensive. Apartments are too small. Is this a
            fix?” (Washington Post), they claim that with fewer
            single-family-only zones, there can be more housing options for
            people. This makes me wonder if there is a correlation between the
            percentage of single-family housing and the number of people living
            there. I feel like there could be a correlation since areas with
            more single-family homes may have fewer people living there since
            they are more expensive and there is less options.

            Percentage of single-family homes by Municipality [For Initial
            Exploration]
            <br />This was an initial exploration to understand the data a bit
            more. Through this I realized some values is over 100%. I digged
            into the dataset a bit more and found that municipalities were split
            into 2 geographic records depending on whether the land was zoned
            only for single-family housing or for other housing types. This made
            me realized the importance of using the unique fid to explore this
            dataset rather than just the municipality name since some
            municipalities had multiple records.

            Population Age Groups by Percentage of Single-Family Housing
            (Stacked Bar) [For Q1]
            <br />
            This was one of my first attempts to answer question 1. I did a
            stacked graph because I wanted to see any clear trends instead of
            just individual data points, and I feel like as I was exploring I
            generally turn to just scatter plot of data points and I wanted to
            try exploring different visualizations instead.
            <br />This stacked bar chart compares the number of residents under
            18, ages 18–64, and ages 65+ based on the percentage of
            single-family housing. This visualization showed me that most places
            have more 18-64 people, and the places that have more older people
            usually have more than 50% of single-family homes. It also clearly
            shows places generally don't have 20–30% or 45–50% single-family
            housing.

            Population Age Groups by Percentage of Single-Family Housing
            (Scatter Plot) [For Q1]
            <br />
            I end up using a scatter plot for question 1 because I feel like
            this does the best job of showing general trends in the data while
            still showing each individual municipality's data point. I also
            switch from just looking at the number to the percentage of people
            in each age group. I think this helps with having a better
            understanding of the composition in each municipality and not having
            the size of the municipality affect whether a lot of older people
            live there or not. This shows that places generally all have the
            same percentage of people under 18, no matter the % of single-family
            homes. Places with around 80-90% have more 18-64 working class which
            makes sense since they may want places with more diversity and
            options. It looks like areas with more than 20% of people over 65
            generally have more than 50% of single-family homes, although some
            do have 0%.

            Percentage of People Over 65 vs. Percentage of Single-Family Housing
            [For Q1]
            <br />
            In this visualization, I did a more detailed visualization of just
            people over 65. Because if my question was if a higher percentage of
            old people in an area with more single-family, I can just focus on
            this percentage. Through more inspection, there's one point
            (Medford) with around 55% of single-family but a high percentage of
            people over 65. However, after digging through the data metadata, I
            found that this is one of the two areas. This one represents the
            area Medford that is not only-single-family, and it only has a
            population of 3 (2 of which is over 65), so I think that data point
            is an outlier. The other potential outlier is the one with 41%
            single-family homes and 55% of older people. That one was Quincy,
            which is part of Greater Boston. I wonder if this one also makes
            sense, as it is made of older people who want to live around Boston,
            but since it is very busy and city-like, they may choose to move
            somewhere else that has a bit more single-family homes but not too
            far from Boston.

            Population of People Over 65 vs. Percentage of Single-Family Housing
            [For Q1]
            <br />
            In this visualization, instead of the general percentage, I wanted
            to look at the pure number of people older than 65. I used the
            population of the area as the coloring so people can still get a
            sense of an area is just very small, and that's why they may have
            fewer people. This was interesting because this reveals that places
            with a higher percentage of single families do generally have more
            older people or a smaller population. Areas with 0 percent of
            single-family are generally under 200 people over 65. While the
            areas that have more than 200 people over 65 have more than 50% of
            single-family housing. There is one outlier with 0 percent single
            family and over 300 people over 65. However, I found out that it’s
            Boston, so it makes sense that it has both a high general population
            and thus more people who will be over 65.

            <br />
            I wanted to try exploring the filtering option with these next 2
            figures. In this one I filter for areas with less than 50%
            single-family homes. In areas with fewer single-family homes, I
            found that there is generally more spread of the number of people
            with low income from 0 to almost 200. The number of African
            Americans also looks pretty diverse, though, across all
            municipalities.

            <br />
            I filter for areas with more than 50% single-family homes in this
            visualization. In these areas, it looks like there are generally
            fewer people with low income (mostly under 75). The spread of the
            number of African Americans is really similar, though. There is an
            area (Randolph) with a lot of African Americans, and I couldn't
            think of why even with additional research. In general, this is
            surprising because I would have expected a clearer difference if a
            higher percentage of single-family home zoning was actually charging
            people out of those areas.

            Percentage of Black or African American Population or Households
            with Income under $10000 vs. percentage of Single Family Homes [For
            Q2]
            <br />Instead of using just raw counts, I plotted three ratios
            together: nhaa/pop, incu10/pop, and (nhaa + incu10)/pop (where nhaa
            = Non-Hispanic Black or African American population and incu10 =
            households with income under $10,000). This allowed me to compare
            the percentage of these groups versus different percentages of
            single-family housing. I realized that (nhaa + incu10)/pop is not a
            perfect measure because it may double count people who are both NHAA
            and INCU10. However, since the recorded NHAA population is generally
            low in many municipalities, I think this combined metric is still
            fine for general data exploration. From this visualization, I
            noticed a slight upward trend, with higher percentages of NHAA or
            INCU10 residents appearing in areas where more than 50% of housing
            is single-family. This is surprising, given the common argument that
            single-family zoning prices out people of color and lower-income
            residents.

            with Income under $10000 vs. percentage of Single Family Homes
            (Without Outliers) [For Q2]
            <br />
            In this visualization, I filter out areas that have a percentage of
            nhaa/pop or incu10/pop over 1, since that’s not possible. Through
            closer checks, these areas have very small populations and large
            populations of incu10, and I think that’s because of data
            misentering. This allowed for a more useful y-axis.
            <br />
            Through this, you can more clearly see an upward trend, especially
            for housing under 1000. Areas that have more than 40% of people
            earning under $10000 are all in areas with more than 50%
            single-family (other than areas with 0% single-family and Melrose).
            I think this could make sense in the context of Massachusetts, since
            it is a more liberal state that may better supports lower-income
            people and people of color to live in these areas. People living in
            Massachusetts are probably more well-off too since we are in a
            generally more pricey area.

            Population vs. Percentage of Single Family Homes (By MBTA Community
            Status) [For Q3]
            <br />

            In this figure, blue is MBTA communities, while red is non-MBTA
            communities. MBTA communities are municipalities served by MBTA
            transit and are required to allow multifamily housing in at least
            one district (Credit:
            <a
              href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/multi-family-zoning-requirement-for-mbta-communities"
              >mass.gov</a
            >). Most municipalities in the dataset are MBTA communities.
            <br />
            It looks like areas with a higher percentage of single-family
            housing actually tend to have slightly higher populations overall.
            In general, the areas with the highest populations (over 800) either
            have 0% or around 60–90% single-family housing which is surprising.
            I think this figure also does a great job showing that generally
            most areas have a high percentage of single-family housing and also
            a large populations.

            <br />
            I do wish this visualization can consider land area too, since some
            smaller municipalities may be 100% single-family but can only
            support a small population due to size constraints. Whether a
            municipality is an MBTA community does not show a strong independent
            trend, except that non-MBTA communities either have 0% or over 80%
            single-family zoning. However some MBTA communities have low
            populations while others have very high populations.

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>
          In general, I think this dataset allowed for great initial exploration
          of how the percentage of single-family housing can affect the age,
          race, income, and population count of the people living there.
          However, I feel like there are some errors in data entry, specifically
          in the case where the number of households earning under $10,000 is
          higher than the total population. I also think land size is an
          important context that can be added, since it affects how many people
          an area can actually support.

          <br />
          <br />
          More specifically, I learned that people over 65 generally do live in
          areas with a higher percentage of single-family housing, which aligns
          with my experiences growing up in Florida, where many retired people
          tend to live in larger, single-family homes. It was interesting to
          look more closely at cities like Boston, Medford, and Quincy to better
          understand why their values fall outside the general trend, though. I
          was surprised that there was not a clearer trend showing a higher
          number of people of color or lower-income residents in areas with less
          single-family housing. I think this could be explored further by
          comparing the number of people earning different income levels across
          varying percentages of single-family housing.
          <br />
          <br />
          It is also surprising that areas with larger populations generally
          have higher percentages of single-family homes. These realizations
          seem to counter the ideas supported by the readings. It was also
          interesting to see that whether a place is or is not an MBTA community
          does not really seem to strongly affect the number of people living
          there.
